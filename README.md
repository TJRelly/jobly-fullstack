# Jobly

Welcome to the Jobly! This repository contains the frontend implementation of the Jobly application, a dynamic job board that allows users to explore companies, search for job opportunities, and apply directly through the platform. The frontend is built using modern web technologies, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## **Features**

- **Browse Companies**: Discover a list of companies along with detailed information and their respective job postings. Easily explore potential employers and the positions they offer.
  
- **Search Jobs**: Utilize the search functionality to filter job postings by keyword. Find and apply for positions that match your skills and interests.

- **User Authentication**: Securely sign up, log in, and manage your profile. The authentication system ensures that only registered users can apply for jobs and save their preferences.

## **Technology Stack**

- **React**: A powerful frontend library used for building the user interface. Reactâ€™s component-based architecture makes the application modular, maintainable, and scalable.
  
- **React Router**: A routing library that enables smooth navigation within the application. React Router ensures that users can easily transition between different pages without reloading the entire app.

- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client used for making requests to the backend API. Axios simplifies data retrieval, enabling the application to dynamically display content based on user interactions.

- **Tailwind**: A responsive design framework that provides a sleek and modern look to the application. Tailwind ensures that the Jobly frontend is fully responsive, offering a consistent experience across all devices.
